# Employee-Tracker
## Description 
For this assignment I built a employee tracker application that allows users to keep log all their employes. Users can also input and view Employee information, such as their, manager id's, roles, salaries, and which department they work in. To view, input, or edit this users can simply use the command line and answer the prompted questions. To achive this I used the inquirer package, MySQL, and the console.table package. Unfortunately, which you will see in the linked video below, I was not able to get the add a department and the add a role functions working properly before the due date of this assignment, but I am planning to come back and work on those to get them working correctly.
